summary: "Research project I worked on with the Hawaii Data Science Institute, where I explored the extent to which the release of CO2 gas by the U.S has
affected sea surface temperature in the North Pacific Basin."

The goal of this research project was to develop and learn a basic skillset in data gathering, data cleaning, and data visualization through a project that could provide
insights on how CO2 affects sea surface temperature.

My findings were that it is highly difficult to pinpoint exactly how much the U.S emitted CO2 has truly affected the sea surface temperature of the North Pacific Basin. What
I could conclude was that the U.S contributed to 14% of the global CO2 whilst only contributing to 4% of the global population. Thus, while difficult to pinpoint the extent to
which the U.S emitted CO2 affected sea surface temperature in the North Pacific Basin, I came to a conclusion that the U.S definitely contributed to the rising sea surface 
temperatures across all oceans.
