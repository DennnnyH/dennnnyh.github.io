<!-- UI Frameworks are not simple. In fact, they can be almost as complicated to learn as a new programming language. Given that, why bother to use something like Bootstrap 5? What does one get in return for the investment of time and frustration? Why not just use raw HTML and CSS? Are the software engineering benefits of UI frameworks?

For this assignment, create an engaging and informative essay about UI Frameworks. You might want to discuss some of the issues raised above, as well as your own personal experience with Bootstrap 5. Or perhaps youâ€™ve also used another framework such as Semantic UI. In that case, it might be interesting to read your perspective on a comparison of the two.

This essay is tailor made to include an image of a web page built with a UI framework (or even a comparison of web pages built with and without a UI framework).

Feel free to go in another direction entirely, as long as you are discussing UI Frameworks, and as long as the result is interesting, informative, and insightful. Write for the world! -->

<h3>Initial Thoughts</h3>
It is a common consensus that UI frameworks are meant to make front end development much easier and quicker. As someone with minimal front end development experience, I would have to take the common consensus and run with it. However, in my experience with using Bootstrap so far, it was still very confusing, and definitely didn't feel quick at all. I can't imagine using plain old CSS and HTML to build the entire interface if even using Bootstrap took me so long. Nonetheless, I see the value in using UI frameworks such as bootstrap because of all their built in options. It just takes getting familiar with the different class options and what they do.

<h3>Why Use UI Frameworks?</h3>
As previously stated, UI frameworks allow for efficient web development. This is done through pre-designed components such as buttons, navigation bars, modals, etc that follow modern design, allowing for professional and well structured looks. UI frameworks such as Bootstrap are also responsive web development frameworks, meaning it doesn't matter what device or screensize an end user accesses a webpage on, the interface will adapt to the device's layout and content to provide the optimal viewing experience for them.  

<h3>Struggles</h3>
Being first introduced to Bootstrap not too long ago, I personally struggle with knowing when to use specific classes for navbars, containers, cards, etc. It is really hard for me to understand what functionality specific features have. Currently, I rely on using AI and reading documentation to gain a better understanding of classes and when to use them. I believe that understanding a UI framework such as Bootstrap is similar to learning any new coding language and framework; everything gets better with experience. Once using Bootstrap becomes second nature in web development, it will save tons of time in comparison to using plain CSS and HTML.

<h3>Closing Remarks</h3>
Learning UI frameworks such as Bootstrap is definitely useful and is a tool I see myself using in the future whether it be in my personal side projects or professional career. As of now, I have used Bootstrap to recreate the homepage of <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/">PCPartPickers</a>. It has definitely been very frustrating because sometimes nothing seems to be turning out the way I have it thought out to be. I look forward to becoming more skilled in Bootstrap and other UI frameworks so I can feel the satisfication of building professional looking responsive web pages efficiently.
