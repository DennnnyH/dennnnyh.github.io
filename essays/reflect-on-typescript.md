<h3>First Impressions of TypeScript</h3>
Before taking this course, I had only heard about Typescript. I mistakenly thought it was an all-in-one language that combined HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a single tool for full-stack development. Boy was I wrong… It wasn’t till actually learning Typescript that I realized it was a superset of JavaScript that allowed for static typing and compiled into JavaScript. A lot of the syntax of TypeScript felt similar to that of Java, making learning the syntax relatively easy. However, this doesn’t take away from the fact that I may still periodically miss a semicolon…

<h3>Usefulness</h3>
TypeScript is a popular and widely used language amongst many software engineers, particularly frontend developers. If many in the industry are using it, I wouldn’t necessarily argue that it is a bad programming language. However, in terms of personal preference, I still lean towards Python.

<h3>Athletic Software Engineering</h3>
I find athletic software engineering useful because it emulates the time factor of a technical interview. This style of learning adds pressure to solve problems fast and accurately, so I think it’s a good style of learning that prepares students for interviews. I found the workout of the day assignments (WODs) pretty fair in difficulty. The homework WODs were relatively easy, while the in-class ones were a little more challenging. I think it’ll work for me with time. Although I didn’t do the best on the in-class practice exercise, I’m confident that with repetition and practice, I’ll improve and do better. The goal for me is to use this style of learning to better prepare to succeed in future technical interviews.

<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
Nonetheless, I look forward to learning more about software engineering and continuing to grow my skills throughout this course.
