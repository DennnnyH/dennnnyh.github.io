<h3>Initial Thoughts</h3>
Coding standard... something I never thought I'd have issues with as I felt the way I structured my code was "the standard" way. Turns out there isn't a universal coding standard. Instead, there exists different standards for different organizations and programming languages. Getting familiar with the ESLint coding standard has been a little troublesome, it's like I'm learning grammar all over again, but this time for Typescript. My current most irrational fear is typing "npm run lint" in the terminal and getting 10 error messages, individually going through each "error" can be painful at times especially if it's just forgetting to create a new line or having an extra space. However, I do believe that this builds a good habit of writing high quality code, that will make it easier for peer code review in the near future. Having good coding standard is a matter of familiarity of the standard you're working with and repitition. The more you're exposed to it, the easier it gets, I would say it is very comparable to basic English grammar.

<h3>Importanace of Coding Standards</h3>
Coding standards within an organization or a group of engineers set a "universal language" for writing software. It acts as a guideline in how code should be formatted, structured, and documented. By following a coding standard, it makes processes such as code reviews much easier and faster. When we can code review quicker, we can be more productive on finishing a project and delivering the product.

<h3>Challenges in Enforcing Coding Standards</h3>
Learning a new coding standard isn't easy, it's similar to learning a new set of grammar rules. I personally believe that there isn't much of a steep learning curve to learning a new coding standard. As we program more under a set of coding standards, we will get more used to it, things will come naturally and it will become part of the way we think about writing code.

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
Adopting to a new set of coding standards is frustrating at first (as I am experiencing right now), but in the long term, the benefits outweight the initial struggles. Standard creates consistency, which is directly correlated to efficiency. While getting familiar with ESLint feels frustrating because of how strict it is, it pushes me to write higher quality and cleaner code.
