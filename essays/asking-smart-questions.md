<h3>Introduction</h3>
With any problem we encounter as engineers, as students, as people, we instinctively look for solutions to the problem. How do we do so? Typically, we ask questions to ourselves, to our peers, and to those with more experience in the hopes of finding guidance or a solution that appropriately resolves our underlying issues. With that said, asking a smart question is especially relevant for software engineers because the whole premise of our job is to resolve other people's problems and make their lives easier. From one engineer to another, asking a well-framed smart question may turn lightbulbs on and spark new insights, not just for ourselves, but for our peers as well.
