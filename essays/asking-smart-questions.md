<h3>Introduction</h3>
With any problem we encounter as engineers, as students, as people, we instinctively look for solutions to the problem. How do we do so? Typically, we ask questions to ourselves, to our peers, and to those with more experience in the hopes of finding guidance or a solution that appropriately resolves our underlying issues. With that said, asking a smart question is especially relevant for software engineers because the whole premise of our job is to fix other people's problems and make their lives easier. From one engineer to another, asking a well-framed, smart question may turn on the lightbulbs and spark new insights, not just for ourselves, but for our peers as well.

<h3>What is a 'smart question'?</h3>
A smart question, by the definition of Eric Steven Raymond and Rick Moen, in short, is a question that is well researched, clearly stated, precise, respectful of your reader's time, and focused on real evidence and goals. To be well-researched means you have exhausted all accessible resources available to you before confronting someone. This includes reading FAQs, doing a quick Google search, looking on Reddit, asking an LLM, etc. When you have done proper research and found no answer, write a question that states what you have already tried doing, what happened when you tried the other solutions, and how your problem relates to your larger goal. A precise question may even go further, where the user provides screenshots or any concrete evidence of errors that may be helpful to the person helping. Respecting the reader's time means writing in clear language, minimizing typos, and including concise details. By asking a smart question, you make the lives of others trying to help you much easier, and raise your chances of getting a quick and useful response.

<h2>Example of a smart question</h2>
Finding a smart question on Stack Overflow wasn't too difficult. Here is the link to the smart question I found:
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array">
  this is the link
</a>. This was the top one most upvoted question on Stack Overflow. This question is considered a smart question because it presents a problem the user is trying to find out, an example with concrete evidence that the user has explored a level of research before asking the question, and a higher-level goal the user wants to achieve. The user is questioning why his provided code runs six times faster on sorted data compared to unsorted data. They stated that they tested the same problem in another coding language and experienced the same issue. Their goal was to understand why processing a sorted array is faster than an unsorted array in their given context, which is a question others might have in the future.

<h2>Example of a not-so-smart question</h2>
I was able to find a non-smart question that was asked on the day of writing this essay. Here is the link to the non-smart question I found:
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79761410/how-can-i-manage-the-if-in-python"> this is the link
</a>. This question is considered a non-smart question to me because the user explicitly says it's their first time on Stack Overflow, so they don't know how to upload an image of their code, showing a lack of research already. Then the user asks a very basic question that can be answered through Google or by asking an LLM. In addition, the user doesn't explain any troubleshooting they tried before consulting for help, which to me indicates little to no effort was put in by the user to solve the problem independently. Altogether, this question seems like a lazy question where the user wants an answer to their question without putting in the effort expected of someone asking for help.

<h3>My Thoughts</h3>
I often hear "no question is a bad question", but after reading and further understanding Eric Steven Raymond and Rick Moen, I can confidently say there are bad questions given certain contexts. In a classroom setting, where students are learning new content? It's likely harder to ask a "bad" question if the question is regarding the content because it shows engagement, and the question likely helps clarify the material for the individual and likely peers. However, in an online community such as Stack Overflow or Stack Exchange, a "bad" question can be quite common. These are usually questions that show no prior research, fail to include details that can be useful for the solution, etc.
