<h1> Initial Thoughts </h1>

<p>
Walking into this class, I didn't have a clear understanding of what a software engineer's daily work flow included. I had a general idea that software engineers write and debug code, collarborate with team members, and solve problems, but I didn't know the specifics of how these tasks were accomplished. Over the course of this class, I have learned that the software engineering lifecycle is a complex process that involves multiple stages, including requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each stage requires different skills and tools, and software engineers must be able to adapt to changing requirements and technologies.
</p>

<h1> User Interface Frameworks </h1>

<p>
One of the key topics covered in this class was user interface frameworks. User interface frameworks are pre-built libraries and tools that help developers create consistent, responsive, and visually appealing user interfaces. In this course, I learned about popular frameworks such as React, Bootstrap, and Next.js, and how they can be used to create dynamic and responsive web applications. I found it awesome that these pre-built frameworks can significantly speed up the development process and improve the user experience. I also learned about the importance of responsive design and how to create interfaces that work well on different devices and screen sizes. Overall, I found the topic of user interface frameworks to be intriguing. I hope to learn more about human computer interaction and how user interfaces can be designed to be more intuitive, user friendly, and interactive for all users.

<h1> Agile Project Management </h1>

<p>
Agile is a project management method that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development. In this class, we used issues driven project management through GitHub Issues to manage our projects. This helped us break down our projects into tasks that each member of the group project is responsible for. This helped us stay organized and on track, allowing us to estimate the effort required and the actual effort spent on each task. I found this method to be effective in managing our projects, as it allowed us to adapt to changing requirements and priorities. By breaking down the project into smaller tasks, we were able to focus on specific areas and make progress more efficiently. Overall, I found agile project management to be a valuable tool for software development, and I look forward to using it in future projects.
</p>

<h1> Coding Standards </h1>

<p>
Coding standards are a set of guidelines and best practices that developers must follow when writing code within an organization. In this class, we learned about the importance of coding standards in ensuring that code is readable, maintainable, and consistent across a team. We were introduced to various coding standards, such as naming conventions, code formatting, documentation practices, and ESLint. I found it interesting to learn about the different coding standards used in the industry and how they can improve collaboration and communication among team members. By following coding standards, developers can ensure that their code is easy to understand and modify, which is essential for code reviews, maintainability, and scalability. Overall, I found the topic of coding standards to be important for software development, and I plan to continue incorporating these practices into my future projects.
</p>

<h1> Final Thoughts </h1>

<p>
Throughout this course, I was able to learn much more about the software engineering lifecycle and the various tools and practices used in the industry. From user interface frameworks to agile project management and coding standards, I gained a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in software development. I look forward to applying these concepts and skills in my future endeavors as a software engineer.
