*Committing to my future*

# discuss your interests in software engineering and what kinds of skills and experiences you hope to develop in the future.

Growing up, I was always a problem solver and critical thinker, whether it was thinking of clever arguments to convince my mom to buy the LEGO set I wanted, or it be figuring out creative ways to complete school projects with a small supply of resources. Over time, as I spent more time on the internet, the same curiosity and persistence grew into an interest in the tech world. The tech world is large and broad; however, software engineering suits my personality and strengths well. Design, build, optimize, and maintain systems that solve real-world problems. Therefore, in a world of ever-evolving technology, I see software engineering as an opportunity for me to challenge myself and grow, while creating a lasting impact to solve at least one person's problem.
<h1>Interests</h1>
My interests in software engineering lie in its foundation of problem-solving. Software engineers take problems that exist in the world and find optimal solutions to them. I enjoy taking on large problems, breaking them down into smaller problems, and then making a constant effort to find efficient solutions. I am someone who heavily relies on communicating my problems, my thought process, and potential solutions with others, both verbally and through visual representations. I believe sharing and visualizing every step of the process, whether it's just on a whiteboard, with myself, or scheduling a team meeting to discuss with team members

In the future, I hope to develop a skillset in artificial intelligence, machine learning, software engineering, and data analysis. I want to gain experience working on projects that involve large-scale data, predictive modeling, and real-world applications of AI/ML. At the same time, I hope to strengthen my software engineering fundamentals, such as system design, testing, and optimization, so that I can build solutions that are both innovative and reliable.
